#Conclusion:At the 90% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant relationship between household income levels and age differences in couples. Specifically, as the income midpoint increases, the age difference between partners decreases, suggesting a negative relationship. This supports the hypothesis that different age groups in the labor force exhibit significant differences in age gaps compared to those not in the labor force.

# t-stat: 14.560 
#p-value: <2e-16
#Conf int: (-3.896278e-01) , (-3.105302e-01)

# Conclusion:
#At the 90% confidence level, examine if the confidence interval for `income_midpoint` excludes zero. A significant p-value and confidence interval excluding zero suggest that income influences age differences among couples in the labor force. Since the p-value is extremely small, the t-statistic is large, and the confidence interval does not contain zero, we reject the null hypothesis. This means we have strong evidence to conclude that women do not use food stamps more than men.


```

#Results
```{r Question 1c}
#Null Hypothesis: Women use food stamps at a higher rate than men.
#H₀: w > m

#Alternative Hypothesis: Women do not use food stamps more than men.
#H₁: w ≤ m


#this is a left tailed test 

#confidence interval is 95% 

#z-score is -1.645

#the t stat must be less than or equal to the z score. 

#2e-16 is greater than -1.645. 

#P-vaLue: < 2e-16 
#T-stat: -9.796
#Confint: [-0.3972, -0.3029]

#Conclusion: Since the t-stat is greater than the z-score, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, women do use more food stamps than men.

```{r Question 2}
For my topic selection I would be interested in Free trade and NAFTA, I tried to focus in articles that can help to undertand the impact that international trade have had on the US economy, employment and income infect.

#1) 	Newspaper article from The New York Times: Biden Administration Ratchets Up Tariffs on Chinese Goods. (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/biden-tariffs-chinese-goods-clothing.html)
The Biden administration is imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports, affecting goods such as clothing, electric vehicles, and solar panels. 
This move, aimed at protecting American industries and reducing dependency on China, will impose tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on various items that have been priced lower than American goods,
often threatening U.S. businesses.

#2) 2.	Newspaper article from The New York Times: How NAFTA Broke American Politics. (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/podcasts/the-daily/american-politics-trade.html?)
This article explores the long-term effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the U.S. economy and politics. 
Passed in 1993 under President Clinton, NAFTA aimed to foster free trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, promising increased exports and job creation. 
However, NAFTA led to significant job losses in U.S. manufacturing as companies relocated to Mexico for cheaper labor. 
This shift left a lasting impact on the Rust Belt and other industrial regions, increasing unemployment and wage stagnation among working-class Americans.

While analyzing some Econometric tools that can be used I found three interesting ones:
1.	Regression Analysis: Basic regression models would likely estimate the effect of tariffs on prices and quantities, isolating the impact on prices for consumers versus the possible price adjustments by foreign suppliers.

2.	Difference-in-Differences (DiD): This tool could analyze the effects of tariffs on prices and imports by comparing periods before and after the tariff impositions, assuming a “natural experiment” setting, as with the Trump-era tariffs.

3.	Data Analysis: To assess longitudinal impacts across different industries or regions for NAFTA’s effects, using data models could reveal how variables like employment, wages, or industry outputs changed over time and across locations.
